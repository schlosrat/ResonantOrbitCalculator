## Sales Pitch
Would you like to know just what orbit to get your craft into so it's ready to deploy a constellation of satellites? Are you in a hurry and don't want to spend time performing tedious computations involving obscure and arcane orbital mechanics equations? Well, now you can! Look no further - Resonant Orbit Calculator is at hand and ready to help you sort out your next Comm Sat deployment mission in a snap!

## Marketing Materials
With Resonant Orbit Calculator (ROC) by your side, you'll quickly be able to see all the important details for the Current Orbit your Carrier Vessel is in, as well as being able to plan your Deployment Orbit.

No matter if your deploying 2 Payloads or 52, the ROC will get you all set up with everything you need to know. Just click the <-> and <+> buttons next to the number of satellites you're carrying and you'll be off to the races!

Would you like to only deploy a satellite once every 2nd or 3rd or 27th pass? We've got you covered there, too! Just click away to quickly set your Deploy Orbits from 1 each pass on up to whatever you need! The ROC will even tell you exactly what Orbital Resonance factor will be needed to execute your plan!

Have you got a specific Target Altitude you need your satellites in? There's a handy spot right there ready for you enter any value you like, and you'll instantly be able to see the orbital period your deployed sats will have (assuming circular orbits).

What if you want to set your satellites up so they're in Synchronous or Semi-Synchronous orbits? That info is displayed for you (assuming such orbits are possible for the body you're in orbit about).

And if you're seeing the dreaded Outside SOI warning for either of these, then don't fret! The SOI Altitude is also displayed so you'll now what the max is!

But what if you don't care about the max and are more interested in the Minimum LOS Orbit? We've got you covered there, too! (for any constellation with 3 or more satellites only...). You can even sort that out to account for occlusion due to a planet's atmosphere (if it's got one).

When it comes time to set up your Deployment Orbit, you've got an option to either Dive under your target orbit or climb higher for your resonant deployment orbit. Either way works in general, but watch out for lithobraking Periapsis when diving. Similarly watch out for SOI escaping Apoapsis when climbing.

Your choice for Diving or Climbing doesn't just impact opportunities for lithobraking and SOI escape, you'll also be able to quickly see the required Injection Delta-v your satellites will need to supply in order to circularize their orbits when you release them! This is not to be confused with whatever Delta-v you may need to get your Carrier Vessel into the deployment orbit, but this does need to be accounted for so that you'll know your satellites are prepared to complete their own circularization when you deploy them!

What about getting your craft into the Deployment Orbit? Just add a maneuver node to your current orbit and you'll be able to see where it's taking you in the Maneuver section!
